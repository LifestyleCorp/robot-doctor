### 2. Log Collection

#### 2.1 Log Types

**Objective:**  
To define the types of logs that should be collected for the HRD system.

**Types of Logs:**
- **System Logs:** Capture events related to the HRD operating system, including boot logs, shutdown logs, and error messages.
- **Application Logs:** Record events from HRD software applications, including user interactions, application errors, and performance metrics.
- **Security Logs:** Track security-related events, such as login attempts, access control changes, and security alerts.
- **Network Logs:** Monitor network activity, including connection attempts, bandwidth usage, and network errors.

#### 2.2 Log Sources

**Objective:**  
To identify the sources from which logs will be collected.

**Sources:**
- HRD operating system
- HRD application software
- Network devices (e.g., routers, switches)
- Security systems (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems)

### 3. Log Storage

#### 3.1 Storage Requirements

**Objective:**  
To ensure that logs are stored securely and are easily accessible for analysis.

**Requirements:**
- **Capacity:** Ensure sufficient storage capacity to retain logs for a specified retention period.
- **Security:** Implement access controls to protect log data from unauthorized access.
- **Redundancy:** Use redundant storage systems to prevent data loss.
- **Compression:** Compress logs to save storage space while maintaining data integrity.

#### 3.2 Retention Policy

**Objective:**  
To define the retention period for different types of logs.

**Retention Periods:**
- **System Logs:** Retain for 1 year.
- **Application Logs:** Retain for 1 year.
- **Security Logs:** Retain for 2 years.
- **Network Logs:** Retain for 1 year.

### 4. Log Analysis

#### 4.1 Analysis Tools

**Objective:**  
To utilize tools for effective log analysis.

**Tools:**
- **Log Management Software:** Use software like Splunk, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), or Graylog for log collection, storage, and analysis.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:** Use SIEM systems to analyze security logs and identify potential threats.

#### 4.2 Analysis Procedures

**Objective:**  
To establish procedures for analyzing logs to identify and resolve issues.

**Procedures:**
1. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Set up automated alerts for critical events.
   - Monitor logs daily for unusual patterns or errors.

2. **Incident Investigation:**
   - Investigate incidents by correlating logs from different sources.
   - Identify the root cause of issues and take corrective actions.

3. **Performance Analysis:**
   - Analyze logs to monitor system performance and identify bottlenecks.
   - Generate performance reports to track system health over time.

4. **Security Analysis:**
   - Review security logs to detect unauthorized access or suspicious activity.
   - Implement measures to address security vulnerabilities.

### 5. Log Archiving

#### 5.1 Archiving Procedures

**Objective:**  
To ensure that logs are archived properly for long-term storage.

**Procedures:**
1. **Log Rotation:**
   - Implement log rotation policies to manage the size and number of log files.
   - Archive older logs based on the retention policy.

2. **Archival Storage:**
   - Store archived logs in a secure, offsite location.
   - Ensure archived logs are encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.

#### 5.2 Accessing Archived Logs

**Objective:**  
To provide procedures for accessing archived logs when needed.

**Procedures:**
1. **Request Access:**
   - Submit a request to the IT department to access archived logs.
   - Provide justification and required timeframe for the log access.

2. **Retrieve Logs:**
   - IT department retrieves the requested logs from archival storage.
   - Ensure logs are decrypted and securely transferred to the requester.
