### 6. Example Performance Dashboard

Below is a basic example of how the performance dashboard can be visualized using Python with matplotlib and other necessary libraries.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample data for demonstration
cpu_usage = np.random.randint(20, 80, size=100)
memory_usage = np.random.randint(30, 90, size=100)
network_activity = np.random.randint(100, 1000, size=100)
time = np.arange(100)

# Create subplots
fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(10, 15))

# CPU Usage
axs[0].plot(time, cpu_usage, label='CPU Usage', color='b')
axs[0].set_title('CPU Usage')
axs[0].set_xlabel('Time')
axs[0].set_ylabel('Usage (%)')
axs[0].legend()
axs[0].grid(True)

# Memory Usage
axs[1].plot(time, memory_usage, label='Memory Usage', color='g')
axs[1].set_title('Memory Usage')
axs[1].set_xlabel('Time')
axs[1].set_ylabel('Usage (%)')
axs[1].legend()
axs[1].grid(True)

# Network Activity
axs[2].plot(time, network_activity, label='Network Activity', color='r')
axs[2].set_title('Network Activity')
axs[2].set_xlabel('Time')
axs[2].set_ylabel('Activity (KB/s)')
axs[2].legend()
axs[2].grid(True)

# Display the dashboard
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This script provides a basic visualization of CPU usage, memory usage, and network activity over time. For a comprehensive dashboard, use a tool like Grafana or Kibana for real-time data visualization and alerts.
