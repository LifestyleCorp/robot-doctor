### 4. **Calibration Procedures**

#### 4.1 Pressure Sensors

**Calibration Steps:**
1. Use a known pressure source to apply specific pressures to the sensor.
2. Record the sensor output at each pressure.
3. Adjust the calibration settings in the HRD Control Software to match the known pressures.

**Code Example:**
```c
void calibratePressureSensor() {
    float knownPressures[] = {0, 25, 50, 75, 100};
    float sensorOutputs[5];

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        sensorOutputs[i] = readPressureSensor();
        // Record sensor output for known pressure
    }

    // Adjust calibration curve based on known pressures and sensor outputs
    // ...
}
```

#### 4.2 Force Sensors

**Calibration Steps:**
1. Apply known weights to the sensor.
2. Record the sensor output for each weight.
3. Update the calibration settings in the HRD Control Software accordingly.

**Code Example:**
```c
void calibrateForceSensor() {
    float knownWeights[] = {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    float sensorOutputs[6];

    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        sensorOutputs[i] = readForceSensor();
        // Record sensor output for known weight
    }

    // Adjust calibration curve based on known weights and sensor outputs
    // ...
}
```

#### 4.3 Tactile Sensors

**Calibration Steps:**
1. Use known weights to apply specific pressures to the sensor.
2. Record the sensor output at each pressure.
3. Adjust the calibration settings in the HRD Control Software.

**Code Example:**
```c
void calibrateTactileSensor() {
    float knownPressures[] = {0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25};
    float sensorOutputs[6];

    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        sensorOutputs[i] = readTactileSensor();
        // Record sensor output for known pressure
    }

    // Adjust calibration curve based on known pressures and sensor outputs
    // ...
}
```

#### 4.4 Actuators

**Calibration Steps:**
1. Move the actuator to known positions.
2. Verify the actual position matches the commanded position.
3. Adjust the control parameters in the HRD Control Software as needed.

**Code Example:**
```c
void calibrateActuator() {
    int knownPositions[] = {0, 45, 90, 135, 180};
    int actualPositions[5];

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        moveActuator(knownPositions[i]);
        actualPositions[i] = measureActuatorPosition();
        // Record actual position for known command
    }

    // Adjust control algorithm based on known commands and actual positions
    // ...
}
```
