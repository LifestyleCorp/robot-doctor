### 2. Functional Test Cases

#### 2.1 Patient Interaction

**Test Case ID:** TC-FUN-01  
**Description:** Verify the HRD’s ability to record patient history.  
**Preconditions:** HRD is powered on and connected to the control software.

**Steps:**
1. Initiate patient history recording.
2. Input simulated patient data (name, age, symptoms).
3. Save the patient history.

**Expected Result:**  
The HRD accurately records and saves the patient history.

**Test Script:**
```python
def test_record_patient_history(hrd):
    hrd.initiate_history_recording()
    hrd.input_patient_data(name="John Doe", age=30, symptoms="Fever, Cough")
    result = hrd.save_patient_history()
    assert result == "Success"
```

#### 2.2 Diagnostic Capabilities

**Test Case ID:** TC-FUN-02  
**Description:** Verify the HRD’s diagnostic capability based on input symptoms.  
**Preconditions:** HRD is powered on and has access to the diagnostic database.

**Steps:**
1. Input symptoms (e.g., fever, cough).
2. Run diagnostic analysis.
3. Display diagnostic results.

**Expected Result:**  
The HRD provides a list of potential diagnoses based on the input symptoms.

**Test Script:**
```python
def test_diagnostic_capabilities(hrd):
    hrd.input_symptoms(["Fever", "Cough"])
    result = hrd.run_diagnostic_analysis()
    assert "Common Cold" in result or "Flu" in result
```

#### 2.3 Vital Signs Measurement

**Test Case ID:** TC-FUN-03  
**Description:** Verify the HRD’s ability to measure and record vital signs.  
**Preconditions:** HRD is powered on and connected to sensors.

**Steps:**
1. Measure pulse rate.
2. Measure respiratory rate.
3. Measure blood pressure.
4. Measure temperature.
5. Record the vital signs.

**Expected Result:**  
The HRD accurately measures and records the vital signs.

**Test Script:**
```python
def test_vital_signs_measurement(hrd):
    pulse = hrd.measure_pulse()
    respiratory_rate = hrd.measure_respiratory_rate()
    blood_pressure = hrd.measure_blood_pressure()
    temperature = hrd.measure_temperature()
    
    assert pulse is not None
    assert respiratory_rate is not None
    assert blood_pressure is not None
    assert temperature is not None
```

### 3. Performance Test Cases

#### 3.1 Response Time Under Load

**Test Case ID:** TC-PERF-01  
**Description:** Measure the HRD’s response time under peak load conditions.  
**Preconditions:** HRD is connected to the network and handling multiple requests.

**Steps:**
1. Simulate peak usage conditions (e.g., 100 simultaneous users).
2. Measure the response time for patient history recording.
3. Measure the response time for diagnostic analysis.

**Expected Result:**  
The HRD maintains acceptable response times under peak load conditions.

**Test Script:**
```python
import time

def test_response_time_under_load(hrd):
    start_time = time.time()
    hrd.simulate_peak_usage(users=100)
    hrd.record_patient_history(name="Jane Doe", age=25, symptoms="Headache")
    end_time = time.time()
    response_time = end_time - start_time
    
    assert response_time < 2  # Response time should be less than 2 seconds
```

#### 3.2 System Throughput

**Test Case ID:** TC-PERF-02  
**Description:** Evaluate the HRD’s system throughput.  
**Preconditions:** HRD is connected to the network.

**Steps:**
1. Simulate a large number of diagnostic requests (e.g., 500 requests).
2. Measure the number of requests processed per second.

**Expected Result:**  
The HRD processes requests at an acceptable throughput rate.

**Test Script:**
```python
def test_system_throughput(hrd):
    start_time = time.time()
    for _ in range(500):
        hrd.run_diagnostic_analysis(symptoms=["Cough", "Fatigue"])
    end_time = time.time()
    throughput = 500 / (end_time - start_time)
    
    assert throughput > 50  # Should process at least 50 requests per second
```

### 4. Safety Test Cases

#### 4.1 Data Security

**Test Case ID:** TC-SAFE-01  
**Description:** Verify the HRD’s data encryption during storage and transmission.  
**Preconditions:** HRD is connected to the network and operational.

**Steps:**
1. Store patient data.
2. Verify that the data is encrypted.
3. Transmit patient data over the network.
4. Verify that the data is encrypted during transmission.

**Expected Result:**  
Patient data is encrypted during storage and transmission.

**Test Script:**
```python
def test_data_security(hrd):
    hrd.store_patient_data(name="John Doe", age=30, symptoms="Fever")
    assert hrd.is_data_encrypted("storage")

    hrd.transmit_patient_data()
    assert hrd.is_data_encrypted("transmission")
```

#### 4.2 Compliance with Data Privacy Laws

**Test Case ID:** TC-SAFE-02  
**Description:** Ensure the HRD complies with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).  
**Preconditions:** HRD is operational and handling patient data.

**Steps:**
1. Review data handling procedures.
2. Verify compliance with relevant data privacy laws.
3. Ensure patient consent is obtained before data collection.
4. Verify that data access is restricted to authorized personnel only.

**Expected Result:**  
The HRD complies with all relevant data privacy laws and regulations.

**Test Script:**
```python
def test_compliance_with_data_privacy_laws(hrd):
    assert hrd.check_consent_obtained()
    assert hrd.check_authorized_access()
    assert hrd.review_data_handling_procedures() == "Compliant"
```
