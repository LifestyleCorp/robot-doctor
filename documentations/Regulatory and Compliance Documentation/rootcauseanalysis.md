### 1. Introduction

**Objective:**  
The objective of this document is to summarize the root cause analysis (RCA) process undertaken for identified issues or non-conformities within the Humanoid Robot Doctor (HRD) project. This summary outlines the steps taken to identify the underlying causes of problems and the methods used to ensure their effective resolution.

**Scope:**  
This document applies to all issues and non-conformities identified during the HRD project that require a root cause analysis to prevent recurrence.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis Process

#### 2.1 Steps Involved in Root Cause Analysis

1. **Problem Identification:**
   - Clearly define and document the problem or non-conformity.
   
2. **Assemble Investigation Team:**
   - Form a team of relevant experts to investigate the problem.

3. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather data and evidence related to the problem.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Use appropriate tools and techniques to analyze the data and identify root causes.

5. **Root Cause Identification:**
   - Determine the fundamental cause(s) of the problem.

6. **Corrective Action Plan:**
   - Develop a plan to address the root cause(s) and prevent recurrence.

7. **Implementation and Monitoring:**
   - Implement the corrective actions and monitor their effectiveness.

### 3. Tools and Techniques Used

#### 3.1 5 Whys Analysis

**Description:**  
The 5 Whys technique involves asking "why" multiple times (usually five) until the root cause of a problem is identified.

**Example:**
1. **Why** did the HRD stop working?  
   *The power supply failed.*
2. **Why** did the power supply fail?  
   *The power supply overheated.*
3. **Why** did the power supply overheat?  
   *The cooling fan stopped working.*
4. **Why** did the cooling fan stop working?  
   *The fan motor burned out.*
5. **Why** did the fan motor burn out?  
   *The motor was not maintained regularly.*

#### 3.2 Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa Diagram)

**Description:**  
A Fishbone Diagram visually displays potential causes of a problem, categorized into major areas such as People, Processes, Equipment, Materials, Environment, and Management.

**Example:**
- **Problem:** HRD data processing errors
- **Categories:**
  - **People:** Lack of training
  - **Processes:** Inefficient data handling procedures
  - **Equipment:** Malfunctioning sensors
  - **Materials:** Poor quality data cables
  - **Environment:** High humidity affecting electronics
  - **Management:** Inadequate supervision

#### 3.3 Pareto Analysis

**Description:**  
Pareto Analysis uses the 80/20 rule to identify the most significant factors contributing to a problem.

**Example:**
- **Problem:** Frequent system downtimes
- **Findings:** 
  - 80% of downtimes caused by 20% of issues, such as software bugs and hardware failures.

### 4. Summary of Key Root Cause Analysis Findings

#### 4.1 Example 1: Software Bugs

**Problem:** Frequent software crashes during data processing.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Data Collection:** Logs of software crashes, user reports.
- **Analysis Tools Used:** 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram.
- **Root Cause Identified:** Insufficient memory allocation in the software code.

**Corrective Action Plan:**
- Increase memory allocation in the software.
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure stability.

#### 4.2 Example 2: Hardware Failures

**Problem:** Sensors frequently malfunctioning.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Data Collection:** Maintenance records, failure logs.
- **Analysis Tools Used:** 5 Whys, Pareto Analysis.
- **Root Cause Identified:** Poor quality of sensor components.

**Corrective Action Plan:**
- Source higher quality sensor components.
- Implement regular maintenance checks.

### 5. Implementation and Monitoring

**Objective:**  
To ensure the effectiveness of corrective actions and prevent recurrence of problems.

**Procedures:**
- Implement corrective actions as per the developed plan.
- Monitor the performance of corrective actions.
- Conduct follow-up reviews to ensure the problem has been resolved.

**Template:**
| Problem ID | Corrective Action | Implementation Date | Responsible Person | Monitoring Results | Follow-Up Date |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| [ID]       | [Description of corrective action] | [Date]              | [Name/Title]       | [Effective/Not Effective] | [Date]        |

**Responsible Person:**  
Corrective Action Manager, Quality Assurance Manager
