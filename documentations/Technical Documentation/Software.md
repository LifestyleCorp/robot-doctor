### 1. Introduction

**Objective:**  
The objective of this document is to provide a list of free software tools that can be used for designing an anatomically appropriate robot doctor hand with actuators on the forearm. The design should be exportable to the Robot Operating System (ROS) for further development and integration.

**Scope:**  
This document covers free software tools that are suitable for 3D modeling, simulation, and exporting designs to ROS.

### 2. Software Tools

#### 2.1 FreeCAD

**Description:**
FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D CAD modeler that is suitable for designing complex mechanical components. It supports a wide range of file formats, making it easy to export designs to ROS.

**Key Features:**
- Parametric modeling for easy modifications
- Supports various CAD formats (STEP, IGES, STL, etc.)
- Python scripting for customization
- Community support and tutorials

**Website:** [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/)

**Export to ROS:**
Designs can be exported in formats compatible with ROS, such as STL or URDF.

#### 2.2 Blender

**Description:**
Blender is a free and open-source 3D creation suite that supports everything from modeling and rigging to animation and rendering. It can be used to create detailed anatomical models of the robot hand.

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive 3D modeling tools
- Rigging and animation capabilities
- Python scripting for automation
- Extensive community and tutorials

**Website:** [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

**Export to ROS:**
Models can be exported in formats like STL, Collada (DAE), or directly as URDF files using add-ons.

#### 2.3 OpenSCAD

**Description:**
OpenSCAD is a script-based 3D CAD modeler that is particularly useful for creating precise models through programming. It is suitable for designing mechanical parts and exporting them to ROS.

**Key Features:**
- Script-based modeling for precision
- Supports parametric design
- Lightweight and easy to use
- Open-source with community support

**Website:** [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)

**Export to ROS:**
Designs can be exported as STL files, which can then be converted to URDF for ROS integration.

#### 2.4 Gazebo

**Description:**
Gazebo is a powerful open-source robotics simulator that integrates with ROS. It is useful for simulating the robot hand's movements and interactions within a virtual environment.

**Key Features:**
- Physics-based simulation
- ROS integration for real-time control
- Supports sensors and actuators
- Extensive library of robot models

**Website:** [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/)

**Export to ROS:**
Gazebo works directly with ROS, allowing for seamless integration and simulation of the robot hand design.

#### 2.5 ROS Industrial

**Description:**
ROS Industrial is an open-source project that extends ROS capabilities to industrial automation and robotics. It includes tools and libraries for developing and controlling robotic systems.

**Key Features:**
- Extends ROS for industrial applications
- Includes drivers for industrial robots
- Supports motion planning and control
- Community-driven with extensive documentation

**Website:** [ROS Industrial](https://rosindustrial.org/)

**Export to ROS:**
Designs created in other CAD tools can be imported and integrated using ROS Industrial packages.

### 3. Design Workflow

1. **Modeling:**
   - Use FreeCAD, Blender, or OpenSCAD to create the 3D model of the robot doctor hand with actuators on the forearm.
   
2. **Simulation:**
   - Import the model into Gazebo for simulation and testing. Ensure that the model includes appropriate joints and actuators.

3. **Exporting:**
   - Export the 3D model in a format compatible with ROS (e.g., STL, URDF).
   - Use ROS tools to create a URDF file if not done directly in the CAD tool.

4. **Integration:**
   - Integrate the model with ROS for further development, including control algorithms and sensor integration.
