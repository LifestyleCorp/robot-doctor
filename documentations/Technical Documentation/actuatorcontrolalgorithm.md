### Actuator Control Algorithms for the Humanoid Robot Doctor (HRD)

Actuator control algorithms are essential for ensuring the precise and reliable operation of actuators in the Humanoid Robot Doctor (HRD). These algorithms manage the movement and force exertion of actuators, allowing the HRD to perform various tasks accurately. Below are detailed explanations of common actuator control algorithms used in the HRD.

### 1. **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Control**

**Overview:**
- PID control is a widely used feedback control algorithm in robotics and automation. It continuously calculates an error value as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms.

**Components:**
- **Proportional (P):** The proportional term produces an output value that is proportional to the current error value. It is determined by the proportional gain (\( K_p \)).
- **Integral (I):** The integral term is concerned with the accumulation of past errors. If the error has been present for a while, the integral term will accumulate this error. It is determined by the integral gain (\( K_i \)).
- **Derivative (D):** The derivative term is a prediction of future error based on its rate of change. It is determined by the derivative gain (\( K_d \)).

**Equation:**
\[ u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_0^t e(\tau)d\tau + K_d \frac{d}{dt}e(t) \]

Where \( u(t) \) is the control output, \( e(t) \) is the error at time \( t \), \( K_p \) is the proportional gain, \( K_i \) is the integral gain, and \( K_d \) is the derivative gain.

**Code Example:**
```c
float Kp = 2.0;
float Ki = 0.5;
float Kd = 1.0;
float previousError = 0;
float integral = 0;

void pidControl(float setpoint, float measuredValue) {
    float error = setpoint - measuredValue;
    integral += error * dt;
    float derivative = (error - previousError) / dt;
    float output = Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative;
    previousError = error;

    // Apply output to actuator
    setActuatorOutput(output);
}
```

### 2. **Bang-Bang Control**

**Overview:**
- Bang-bang control, also known as on-off control, is a simple control algorithm that switches the actuator fully on or fully off depending on whether the measured variable is above or below the desired setpoint.

**Components:**
- **Setpoint:** The desired value of the controlled variable.
- **Hysteresis:** A small range around the setpoint to prevent excessive switching.

**Equation:**
\[ u(t) = \begin{cases} 
      u_{\text{max}} & \text{if } e(t) > 0 \\
      u_{\text{min}} & \text{if } e(t) \leq 0 
   \end{cases}
\]

Where \( u(t) \) is the control output, \( e(t) \) is the error at time \( t \), \( u_{\text{max}} \) is the maximum output, and \( u_{\text{min}} \) is the minimum output.

**Code Example:**
```c
void bangBangControl(float setpoint, float measuredValue) {
    float hysteresis = 0.1;
    if (measuredValue < setpoint - hysteresis) {
        setActuatorOutput(1); // Full on
    } else if (measuredValue > setpoint + hysteresis) {
        setActuatorOutput(0); // Full off
    }
}
```

### 3. **Feedforward Control**

**Overview:**
- Feedforward control uses a model of the system to predict the necessary control actions to achieve the desired output. It is often used in combination with feedback control (like PID) to improve performance.

**Components:**
- **System Model:** A mathematical representation of the system's behavior.
- **Desired Output:** The target state or performance.

**Equation:**
\[ u(t) = f(r(t)) \]

Where \( u(t) \) is the control output, and \( f \) is the feedforward function based on the desired output \( r(t) \).

**Code Example:**
```c
float systemModel(float desiredOutput) {
    // Simple linear model: u = a * desiredOutput + b
    float a = 1.0;
    float b = 0.0;
    return a * desiredOutput + b;
}

void feedforwardControl(float desiredOutput) {
    float feedforwardOutput = systemModel(desiredOutput);
    setActuatorOutput(feedforwardOutput);
}
```

### 4. **Fuzzy Logic Control**

**Overview:**
- Fuzzy logic control is based on fuzzy set theory and handles the concept of partial truth. Instead of using precise inputs, it uses degrees of truth to make control decisions.

**Components:**
- **Fuzzy Sets:** Represent the degree of membership of inputs.
- **Rules:** Define the relationship between input and output fuzzy sets.
- **Inference Engine:** Applies the rules to the fuzzy sets to determine the output.

**Code Example:**
```c
void fuzzyControl(float error, float rateOfChange) {
    // Define fuzzy sets
    float lowError = max(0, 1 - abs(error) / 10);
    float highError = max(0, abs(error) / 10);
    float slowChange = max(0, 1 - abs(rateOfChange) / 5);
    float fastChange = max(0, abs(rateOfChange) / 5);

    // Apply fuzzy rules
    float controlOutput = 0;
    if (lowError && slowChange) {
        controlOutput = 0.5; // Moderate control action
    } else if (highError || fastChange) {
        controlOutput = 1.0; // Strong control action
    } else {
        controlOutput = 0.2; // Weak control action
    }

    // Set actuator output
    setActuatorOutput(controlOutput);
}
```

### 5. **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**

**Overview:**
- Model predictive control is an advanced method that uses a model of the system to predict future behavior and optimize control actions over a finite time horizon.

**Components:**
- **System Model:** A mathematical representation of the system.
- **Prediction Horizon:** The time period over which predictions are made.
- **Optimization Algorithm:** Optimizes the control actions to minimize a cost function.

**Equation:**
\[ u(t) = \arg\min_u \sum_{k=0}^{N} \left[ Q(r(t+k) - y(t+k))^2 + R u(t+k)^2 \right] \]

Where \( u(t) \) is the control output, \( r(t) \) is the reference trajectory, \( y(t) \) is the predicted output, \( Q \) is the state weight, \( R \) is the control weight, and \( N \) is the prediction horizon.

**Code Example:**
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def mpcControl(systemModel, desiredOutput, currentState):
    N = 10 # Prediction horizon
    Q = np.eye(N) # State weight matrix
    R = np.eye(N) # Control weight matrix

    def costFunction(u):
        y = systemModel(currentState, u)
        return np.sum(Q * (desiredOutput - y)**2 + R * u**2)

    result = minimize(costFunction, np.zeros(N)) # Optimize control actions
    optimalControl = result.x[0] # First control action in the sequence

    setActuatorOutput(optimalControl)
```
