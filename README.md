# Multi-modal Sensation:
- Audio (Voice, Pitch, loudness, timbre,duration, location) using Voice transcribing LLM
- Language(Text multilingual) using multilingual LLM
- Vision (2d image, 3d image ,4d image, video, colour, depth,shape,brightness,motion)  using computer vision models
- Touch (pressure, temperature, pain, vibration, texture)  using computer vision touch sensor
- Stereognosis (Deep learning grasp sensors) using
- Gustatory (sweet, salty, sour,bitter ,umami) using
- Olfactory (aromatic, pungent, musty, fruity, putrid) using
- Proprioception (position sense, kinesthetic sense,muscle tension) using
- vestibular sensation (balance, acceleration) using
- Introceptive sensation (hunger, thirst, fullness, heart rate, respiration) using
- Thermoceptive sensation (heat, cold) using
- Nociceptive sensation (sharp pain, dull pain, burning pain, aching pain) using
- Emotional sensation (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, love) using
