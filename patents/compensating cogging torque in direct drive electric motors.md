[FIG. 1A: Triangular reference trajectory for driving a motor]
[FIG. 1B: Corresponding substantially constant velocity in a first direction and a second direction]
[FIG. 2: Measurement of currents in a first and in a second direction for a full rotation of the motor]

FIG. 1A and 1B show the reference trajectory and resulting velocity profile for the calibration process. 
FIG. 2 illustrates the current measurements in both directions across a full motor rotation.
