1. Core Innovation:
‚úÖ Compact, lightweight, high-torque motor design using a Halbach array magnet structure
‚úÖ Direct drive control with low gear ratios (ideally 1:1 to 1:5) for improved backdriveability and safety
‚úÖ Cable-driven joint actuation for reduced backlash and improved control

2. Key Components:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Rotor with Halbach array magnet structure
2Ô∏è‚É£ Stator with optimized pole design 
3Ô∏è‚É£ Synthetic fiber cable drive system
4Ô∏è‚É£ Differentials for multi-axis joint control
5Ô∏è‚É£ Optimized motor placement in robot structure

3. Key Technical Features:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Magnet thickness optimized to prevent demagnetization at peak torque/temperature
2Ô∏è‚É£ Prime number of rotor pole pairs to reduce cogging torque
3Ô∏è‚É£ Stator design balancing magnetic field strength and weight
4Ô∏è‚É£ Cable routing system allowing joint rotation without affecting cable tension
5Ô∏è‚É£ Novel cable termination method using ball bearings in synthetic sleeves

[FIG. 1A: An expanded view of a compact high torque motor]
[FIG. 1B: The motor according to FIG. 1A showing a series of possible sizes for many of the elements]

FIG. 1A and 1B show the detailed design of the compact, high-torque motor at the heart of this system and possible size variations.

[FIG. 2A: Cross-section of a tooth in the stator]
[FIG. 2B: The diagram of FIG. 2A showing a possible range of dimensions]

FIG. 2A and 2B illustrate the cross-section of a stator tooth and its possible range of dimensions, crucial for optimal balance between magnetic field strength and weight.

4. Operational Mechanism:
1Ô∏è‚É£ High-torque motors drive joints via cable systems
2Ô∏è‚É£ Direct connection between motors and joints (no intermediate shafts)
3Ô∏è‚É£ Differentials enable multi-axis joint control (e.g. elbow bend and twist)
4Ô∏è‚É£ Motors placed closer to robot torso to reduce moving mass
5Ô∏è‚É£ Symmetric motor placement to counteract gravity effects

[FIG. 4: A diagram showing torque transfer from the motor to a differential in a robot arm]

FIG. 4 shows the innovative cable routing system that maintains tension during joint rotations.

[FIG. 5: Examples of a termination housing for the cables in the drive system]

FIG. 5 illustrates examples of termination housing for the cables in the drive system, crucial for maintaining cable tension.

5. Key Advantages:
‚úÖ Improved backdriveability for safer human-robot interaction
‚úÖ Reduced need for complex sensor systems
‚úÖ More accurate position/force control due to reduced backlash and friction
‚úÖ Lighter, more compact joint designs allowing human-like range of motion
‚úÖ Potential for all motors to be mounted near the robot's torso

This technology represents a significant advancement in creating robots that can safely and naturally interact with humans by addressing fundamental limitations of traditional high gear ratio designs.
