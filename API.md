# API Examples
## Motor Control API Example:
```python
#Initialize motor control
motor = MotorControl()

#Move motor to a specific position
motor.move_to(position=90)

#Set motor speed
motor.set_speed(speed=50)

#Stop motor
motor.stop()
```

## Sensor API Example:
```python
#Initialize sensor
pressure_sensor = PressureSensor()

#Read sensor data
pressure = pressure_sensor.read()

#Process data
if pressure > threshold:
    alert("High pressure detected")
```

## EHR API Example:
```python
#Initialize EHR connection
ehr = EHR_API(auth_token="your_auth_token")

#Fetch patient data
patient_data = ehr.get_patient_record(patient_id="12345")

#Update patient record
ehr.update_patient_record(patient_id="12345", data={"diagnosis": "Updated Diagnosis"})
```

## Teleoperation API Example:
```python
#initialize teleoperation
teleop = TeleoperationControl()

#Connect to remote robot
teleop.connect(remote_ip="192.168.1.100")

#Send movement command
teleop.move_hand(position="grasp")

# Disconnect
teleop.disconnect()
```

# Conclusion
Integrating these APIs will enable the robotic humanoid doctor to perform a wide range of medical tasks with precision, reliability, and real-time feedback. 
The APIs facilitate communication between hardware components, AI systems, user interfaces, and medical data systems, ensuring seamless operation and high-quality patient care.
